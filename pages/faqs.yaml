- question: Is XRPL a private blockchain, owned by Ripple?
  answer:
    No, the XRP Ledger is a decentralized, public blockchain. Any changes that
    would impact transaction processing or consensus need to be approved by at least
    80%% of the network. Ripple is a contributor to the network, but its rights are
    the same as those of other contributors. In terms of validation, there are 150+
    validators on the network with 35+ on the Unique Node List (see “What are Unique
    Node Lists (UNLs)?” in the Full FAQ) — Ripple runs 6 of these nodes.
- question: Isn’t Proof of Work the best validation mechanism?
  answer:
    Proof of Work (PoW) was the first mechanism to solve the double spend problem
    without requiring a trusted 3rd party. However the XRP Ledger’s consensus mechanism
    solves the same problem in a far faster, cheaper and more energy efficient way.
- question: How can a blockchain be sustainable?
  answer:
    It’s been widely reported that Bitcoin’s energy consumption, as of 2021,
    is equivalent to that used by Argentina, with much of the electricity Bitcoin
    miners use coming from polluting sources. The XRP Ledger confirms transactions
    through a “consensus” mechanism - which does not waste energy like proof of work
    does - and leverages carbon offsets to be <a href='https://ripple.com/ripple-press/ripple-leads-sustainability-agenda-to-achieve-carbon-neutrality-by-2030/'
